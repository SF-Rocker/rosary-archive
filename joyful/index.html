    <h2>üïäÔ∏è How to Pray the Rosary</h2>

    <p><strong>Begin with the Sign of the Cross:</strong><br />In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

    <p><strong>While holding the crucifix, pray the Apostles‚Äô Creed:</strong><br />I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth;<br />
  and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord;<br />
  Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary,<br />
  Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.<br />
  He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;<br />
  He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;<br />
  From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.<br />
  I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church,<br />
  The communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,<br />
  The resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. </p><br />

    <p><strong>Then pray the Our Father:</strong><br />Our Father, which art in heaven, sanctified be thy name.<br />
    Let thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, in earth also.<br />
    Give us today our supersubstantial bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.<br />
    And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br /> </p>

    <p><strong>Then pray:</strong><br />Three <em>Hail Marys</em> (for Faith, Hope, and Charity), and one <em>Glory Be</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Which is:</strong><br /> <em>Glory Be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,<br />
    as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world without end; amen.<br /> </em> </p>

    <p><strong>For each decade:</strong><br />Announce the mystery, pause for reflection, then pray:<br />One <em>Our Father</em>, ten <em>Hail Marys</em>, and one <em>Glory Be</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>After each decade:</strong><br />You may add: ‚ÄúO my Jesus, forgive us our sins...‚Äù</p>

    <p><strong>Closing Prayers:</strong><br /><em>Hail, Holy Queen</em>... O sweet Virgin Mary. Amen.</p>

    <p><strong>Optional:</strong> Conclude with the <a href="/litanie-lauretane_en.html">Litany of Loreto</a> or another Marian devotion.</p>
