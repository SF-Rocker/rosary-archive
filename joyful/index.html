    <h2>🕊️ How to Pray the Rosary</h2>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>Begin with the Sign of the Cross:</strong><br />In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>While holding the crucifix, pray the Apostles’ Creed:</strong><br />I believe in God, the Father Almighty, <br />
    creator of heaven and earth. <br />
    I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, <br />
    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, <br />
    born of the Virgin Mary, <br />
    suffered under Pontius Pilate, <br />
    was crucified, died, and was buried; <br />
    he descended to the dead. <br />
    On the third day he rose again; <br />
    he ascended into heaven, <br />
    is seated at the right hand of the Father, <br />
    and will come again to judge the living and the dead. <br />
    I believe in the Holy Spirit, <br />
    the holy catholic church, <br />
    the communion of saints, <br />
    the forgiveness of sins, <br />
    the resurrection of the body, <br />
    and the life everlasting. Amen. </p><br />


    <p id="ourFather" class="marian-text"><strong>Then pray the Our Father:</strong><br />Our Father, which art in heaven, sanctified be thy name.<br />
    Let thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, in earth also.<br />
    Give us today our supersubstantial bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.<br />
    And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br /> </p>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>Then pray:</strong><br />Three <em>Hail Marys</em> (for Faith, Hope, and Charity), and one <em>Glory Be</em>.</p>

    <button class="scroll-button" onclick="scrollWithOffset('fourth-mystery')">✝ Go to Fourth Mystery</button>
    <button class="scroll-button" onclick="scrollWithOffset('fifth-mystery')">✝ Go to Fifth Mystery</button>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>Hail Mary Prayer:</strong><br /> <em> Hail Mary full of grace, <br />
    the Lord is with Thee, <br />
    blessed art though among women, <br />
    and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. <br />
    Holy Mary Mother of God, Pray for us sinners, <br />
    now and at the hour of our death; amen.<br /> </p>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>Pray:</strong><br /> <em>Glory Be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,<br />

    Turn then, most gracious advocate,<br />
    thine eyes of mercy toward us,<br />
