      <h2>First Sorrowful Mystery: The Agony in the Garden</h2>
      <p>"Then Jesus cometh with them into a village called Gethsemani,<br />
      and he said to his disciples: Sit you here till i go yonder,<br />
      and pray. And taking to him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,<br />
      he began to wax sorrowful and to be sad. Then he saith to them:<br />
      My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay here, and watch with me.<br />
      And being gone forward a little, he fell upon his face, praying,<br />
      let this chalice pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou." <br /> (Mt 26:36‚Äì39)</p>

      <h2>Second Sorrowful Mystery: The Scourging at the Pillar</h2>
      <p>"Then he released to them Barabbas,<br />
      and having scourged Jesus,<br />
      delivered him unto them for to be crucified."<br /> (Mt 27:26)</p>

    <div class="mystery">
      <h2>Third Sorrowful Mystery: The Crowning with Thorns</h2>
      <p>"Then the president's soldiers taking Jesus into the palace,<br />
      gathered together unto him the whole band.<br />
      and stripping him,<br />
      put a scarlet cloak about him,<br />
      and platting a crown of thorns,<br />
      put it upon his head,<br />
      and a reed in his right hand.<br />
      And bowing the knee before him,<br />
      they mocked him, saying:<br />
      Hail king of the Jews."<br /> (Mt 27:27‚Äì29)</p>

    <div class="mystery">
      <h2>Fourth Sorrowful Mystery: The Carrying of the Cross</h2>
      <p>"And they forced a certain man that passed by,<br />
      Simon a Cyrenean coming from the country,<br />
      the father of Alexander and Rufus,<br />
      to take up his cross.<br />
      And they bring him into the place Golgotha:<br />
      which being interpreted is:<br />
      The place of Calvary." <br /> (Mk 15:21‚Äì22)</p>

    <div class="mystery">
      <h2>Fifth Sorrowful Mystery: The Crucifixion</h2>
      <p>"And after they came to the place which is called Calvary,<br />
      there they crucified him: and the thieves, one on the right hand,<br />
      and the other on the left. And Jesus said: Father, forgive them:<br />
      for they know not what they do. But they dividing his garments, did cast lots.<br />
      And the people stood expecting, and the princes with them derided him, saying:<br />
      Others he hath saved , let him save himself, if this be Christ, the elect of God.<br />
      And the soldiers also mocked him coming to him,<br />
      and offering him vinegar, saying:<br />
      If thou be the king of the Jews,<br />
      save thyself,<br />
      And there was also a supersciption written over him<br />
      in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew letters:<br />
      This is the king of the Jews.<br />
      And one of those thieves that were hanged, blasphemed him, saying:<br />
      If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering,<br />
      rebuked him, saying: Neither doest thou fear God,<br />
      whereas thou art in the same damnation. And we indeed justly,<br />
      for we receive worthy of our doings:<br />
      but this man hath done no evil.<br />
      And he said to Jesus: Lord,<br />
      remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.<br />
      And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee:<br />
      This day thou shalt be with me in paradise.<br />
      And it was almost the sixth hour,<br />
      and there was made darkness upon the whole earth until the ninth hour.<br />
      And the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.<br />
      And Jesus crying with a loud voice said:<br />
      Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.<br />
      And saying this, he gave up the ghost."<br /> (Lk 23:33‚Äì46)</p>

    <h2>üïäÔ∏è How to Pray the Rosary</h2>

    <p><strong>Begin with the Sign of the Cross:</strong><br />In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

    <p><strong>While holding the crucifix, pray the Apostles‚Äô Creed:</strong><br />I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth;<br />
  and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord;<br />
  Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary,<br />
  Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.<br />
  He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;<br />
  He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;<br />
  From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.<br />
  I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church,<br />
  The communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,<br />
  The resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. </p><br />

    <p id="ourFather"><strong>Then pray the Our Father:</strong><br />Our Father, which art in heaven, sanctified be thy name.<br />
    Let thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, in earth also.<br />
    Give us today our supersubstantial bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.<br />
    And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br /> </p>

    <p><strong>Then pray:</strong><br />Three <em>Hail Marys</em> (for Faith, Hope, and Charity), and one <em>Glory Be</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Pray:</strong><br /> <em>Glory Be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,<br />
    as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world without end; amen.<br /> </em> </p>

    <p><strong>For each decade:</strong><br />Announce the mystery, pause for reflection, then pray:<br />One <em>Our Father</em>, ten <em>Hail Marys</em>, and one <em>Glory Be</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>After each decade:</strong><br />You may add: ‚ÄúO My Jesus, forgive us our sins,<br />
    save us from the fires of Hell and lead all souls to Heaven,<br />
    especially those who are in most need of Thy mercy."<br /> </p>

      <p><strong>Closing Prayers:</strong><br /> <em>
    Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,<br />
    our life, our sweetness, and our hope.<br />
    To Thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve.<br />
    To Thee do we send up our sighs,<br />
    mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.<br />
    Turn then, most gracious advocate,<br />
    thy eyes of mercy toward us,<br />
    and after this our exile,<br />
    show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<br />
    O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.<br /> </em>
          .</p>

    <p><strong>Optional:</strong> Conclude with the <a href="/litanie-lauretane_en.html">Litany of Loreto</a> or another Marian devotion.</p>
