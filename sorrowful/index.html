      <p> <strong> "Then Jesus cometh with them into a village called Gethsemani,<br />
      and he said to his disciples: Sit you here till i go yonder,<br />
      and pray. And taking to him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,<br />
      he began to wax sorrowful and to be sad. Then he saith to them:<br />
      My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay here, and watch with me.<br />
      And being gone forward a little, he fell upon his face, praying,<br />
      let this chalice pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou." <br /> (Mt 26:36–39) </strong> </p>

      for they know not what they do. But they dividing his garments, did cast lots.<br />
      And the people stood expecting, and the princes with them derided him, saying:<br />
      Others he hath saved , let him save himself, if this be Christ, the elect of God.<br />
      And the soldiers also mocked him coming to him,<br />

      If thou be the king of the Jews,<br />
      save thyself,<br />
      And there was also a supersciption written over him<br />
      in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew letters:<br />
      This is the king of the Jews.<br />
      And one of those thieves that were hanged, blasphemed him, saying:<br />
      If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering,<br />
      rebuked him, saying: Neither doest thou fear God,<br />
      whereas thou art in the same damnation. And we indeed justly,<br />
      for we receive worthy of our doings:<br />
      but this man hath done no evil.<br />
      And he said to Jesus: Lord,<br />
      remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.<br />
      And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee:<br />
      This day thou shalt be with me in paradise.<br />
      And it was almost the sixth hour,<br />
      and there was made darkness upon the whole earth until the ninth hour.<br />
      And the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.<br />
      And Jesus crying with a loud voice said:<br />
      Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.<br />
      And saying this, he gave up the ghost."<br /> (Lk 23:33–46) </strong> </p>

    <h2>🕊️ How to Pray the Rosary</h2>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>Begin with the Sign of the Cross:</strong><br />In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>While holding the crucifix, pray the Apostles’ Creed:</strong><br />I believe in God, the Father Almighty, <br />
    creator of heaven and earth. <br />
    I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, <br />
    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, <br />
    born of the Virgin Mary, <br />
    suffered under Pontius Pilate, <br />
    was crucified, died, and was buried; <br />
    he descended to the dead. <br />
    On the third day he rose again; <br />
    he ascended into heaven, <br />
    is seated at the right hand of the Father, <br />
    and will come again to judge the living and the dead. <br />
    I believe in the Holy Spirit, <br />
    the holy catholic church, <br />
    the communion of saints, <br />
    the forgiveness of sins, <br />
    the resurrection of the body, <br />
    and the life everlasting. Amen. </p><br />

    <p id="ourFather" class="marian-text"><strong><br />Our Father, which art in heaven, sanctified be thy name.<br />
    Let thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, in earth also.<br />
    Give us today our supersubstantial bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.<br />
    And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br /> </p>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>Then pray:</strong><br />Three <em>Hail Marys</em> (for Faith, Hope, and Charity), and one <em>Glory Be</em>.</p>

    <p class="marian-text"><strong>Hail Mary Prayer:</strong><br /> <em> Hail Mary full of grace, <br />
    the Lord is with Thee, <br />
    blessed art thou among women, <br />
    and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. <br />

    <p class = "marian-text"><strong>After each decade:</strong><br />You may add: “O My Jesus, forgive us our sins,<br />
    save us from the fires of Hell and lead all souls to Heaven,<br />
    especially those who are in most need of Thy mercy; amen."<br />

    Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,<br />
    our life, our sweetness, and our hope.<br />
    To Thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve.<br />
    To Thee do we send up our sighs,<br />
    mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.<br />
    Turn then, most gracious advocate,<br />
    thine eyes of mercy toward us,<br />
    and after this our exile,<br />
    show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<br />
    O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.<br /> </em>
