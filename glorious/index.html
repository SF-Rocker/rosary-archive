Gethsemani, and he said to his disciples: Sit you here till I go yonder,
and pray. And taking to him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began
to wax sorrowful and to be sad. Then he saith to them: My Soul is sorrowful
even unto death: stay here, and watch with me. And being gone forward a little,
he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let
this chalice pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou. &quot;

  <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#007c91;">üïäÔ∏è How to Pray the Rosary</h2>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;">
    <strong>Begin with the Sign of the Cross:</strong><br />
    In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;">
    <strong>While holding the crucifix, pray the Apostles‚Äô Creed:</strong><br />
    I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth;
    and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord;
    Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary,
    Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
    He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;
    He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;
    From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
    I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church,
    The communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
    The resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;">
    <strong>Then pray the Our Father:</strong><br />
    Our Father, which art in heaven, sanctified be thy name.
    Let thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, in earth also.
    Give us today our supersubstantial bread, and forgive us our debts,
    as we also forgive our debtors.
    And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;">
    <strong>Then pray:</strong><br />
    Three <em>Hail Marys</em> (for Faith, Hope, and Charity), and one <em>Glory Be</em>.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;">
    <strong>For each decade:</strong><br />
    Announce the mystery, pause for reflection, then pray:<br />
    One <em>Our Father</em>, ten <em>Hail Marys</em>, and one <em>Glory Be</em>.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;">
    <strong>After each decade:</strong><br />
    You may add an invocation such as: ‚ÄúO my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy.‚Äù
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;">
    <strong>Closing Prayers:</strong><br />
    <em>Hail, Holy Queen</em>:<br />
    Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy; hail, our life, our sweetness and our hope.
    To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
    Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy towards us; and after this our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
    O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Amen.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;">
    <strong>Optional:</strong> Conclude with the <a href="litanie-lauretane_en.html" style="color:#007c91;">Litany of Loreto</a> or another Marian devotion.
