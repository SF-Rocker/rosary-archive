  <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#007c91;">üïäÔ∏è How to Pray the Rosary</h2>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;"><strong>Begin with the Sign of the Cross:</strong><br />In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;"><strong>While holding the crucifix, pray the Apostles‚Äô Creed:</strong><br />I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth;<br />
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord;<br />
Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary,<br />
Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.<br />
He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;<br />
He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;<br />
From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.<br />
I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church,<br />
The communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,<br />
The resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. </p><br />

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;"><strong>Then pray the Our Father:</strong><br />Our Father, which art in heaven, sanctified be thy name.<br />
Let thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, in earth also.<br />
Give us today our supersubstantial bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.<br />
And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p><br />

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;"><strong>Then pray:</strong><br />Three <em>Hail Marys</em> (for Faith, Hope, and Charity), and one <em>Glory Be</em>.</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;"><strong>For each decade:</strong><br />Announce the mystery, pause for reflection, then pray:<br />One <em>Our Father</em>, ten <em>Hail Marys</em>, and one <em>Glory Be</em>.</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;"><strong>After each decade:</strong><br />You may add: ‚ÄúO my Jesus, forgive us our sins...‚Äù</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;"><strong>Closing Prayers:</strong><br /><em>Hail, Holy Queen</em>Hail, Holy Queen:<br />
Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy;<br />
    hail, our life, our sweetness and our hope.<br />
    To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve;<br />
    to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.<br />
    Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy towards us;<br />
    and after this our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<br />
    O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Amen. </p> <br />

  <p style="font-size:1.15em; line-height:1.7;"><strong>Optional:</strong> Conclude with the <a href="/rosary-archive/litanie-lauretane_en.html" style="color:#007c91;">Litany of Loreto</a> or another Marian devotion.</p>
